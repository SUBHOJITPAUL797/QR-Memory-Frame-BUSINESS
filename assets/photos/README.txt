IMPORTANT: HOW TO ADD PHOTOS

1. Put your client's photos in this folder.
2. You MUST rename them sequentially:
   - 1.jpg
   - 2.jpg
   - 3.jpg
   - 4.jpg
   - ... and so on.

3. Name your Hero Image (the large background image) as:
   - hero.jpg

4. Go to the root folder and open 'config.js'.
5. Update 'photoCount' to match the number of photos you added (e.g., photoCount: 10).

That's it! The website will automatically load them.
