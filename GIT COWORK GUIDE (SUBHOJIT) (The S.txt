How to Save & Push Your Code (The Simple Version)
Imagine your code is like a letter you are writing. Sending it to GitHub takes 3 Steps. You cannot skip any of them!

Step 1: The Envelope (Add)
First, you have to put your changes into the envelope.

git add .
(This command tells Git: "I want to save ALL the files I changed.")

Step 2: The Seal & Label (Commit)
Next, you must seal the envelope and write a message on it so you know what's inside. This is the step you likely missed!

git commit -m "Updated the site configuration"
(This command actually saves the snapshot. If you skip this, there is nothing to push!)

Step 3: The Mailbox (Push)
Finally, you send the envelope to GitHub.

git push
(This sends your committed changes to the cloud.)

Why did it say "Everything up to date"?
If you run git add . and then immediately git push, the computer says:

"You haven't sealed the envelope yet (committed)! I have nothing new to send."

So remember the mantra:

git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
Part 2: Working with a Friend (Collaboration)
Since you have a friend working with you, here is the Golden Rule: "Always PULL before you start working."

How your Friend gets started (Day 1)
Clone the Repo:
git clone https://github.com/SUBHOJITPAUL797/QR-Memory-Frame-BUSINESS.git
cd QR-Memory-Frame-BUSINESS
Install Bun: (Critical! Because we use 
server.js
)
Windows: powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
Mac/Linux: curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
Install Dependencies:
bun install
Start the Site:
bun run dev
Theoretically Daily Routine (For Both of You)
Morning (Start): Get your friend's changes.
git pull
Work: Change code, update photos, use Admin panel.
Save:
git add .
git commit -m "I added new photos"
Share: Send it to GitHub.
git push
Solution: Try not to edit the same client's config at the exact same time. Or just communicate: "I'm setting up Client A now, you work on the CSS."
Part 3: The "Magic" of Merging (How to avoid losing work)
You asked: "If I pull his work, will my work be erased?" The answer is NO, as long as you follow this one rule:

The Rule: "Seal the Envelope First"
Think of your changes like a letter on your desk.

If you leave it on the desk (Uncommitted) and someone dumps a pile of new mail on top of it (git pull), your letter might get messed up or lost.
If you put it in an envelope and seal it (git commit), it is now protected. Even if a truckload of mail comes in, your letter is safe inside its envelope.
What happens when you Pull?
When you have your work committed and you run git pull:

Scenario A (Different Files): You worked on 
admin.html
, he worked on 
server.js
. Git says "Easy!" and just puts both files in the folder.
Scenario B (Same File, Different Lines): You changed line 10, he changed line 50. Git is smart enough to combine them.
Scenario C (Conflict): You BOTH changed line 10. Git will STOP and tell you. It will NOT delete your work. It will say "I have a conflict, please pick one."
So, never be afraid to Pull. Just Commit first!

Part 4: "Help! We both updated at the same time!" (The Scenario You Asked About)
Situation:

Your friend was working on his computer.
YOU pushed a bunch of updates (Typography, Templates, etc.).
Your friend is now "Behind" but also has his "Own Changes".
Instructions for your Friend:

Tell him to run these exact commands in order:

Option A: The "Clean" Way (Recommended)
This puts HIS changes on top of YOUR changes, so it looks like he did his work after you.

# 1. Save his work first!
git add .
git commit -m "My latest changes"
# 2. Pull your changes and replay his on top (Rebase)
git pull --rebase origin main
# 3. Push everything back
git push origin main
Option B: The "Safe" Way (If Rebase is scary)
This just mashes everything together.

# 1. Save his work
git add .
git commit -m "My latest changes"
# 2. Pull your changes (This will open a weird text editor, just type :q! to exit or close it)
git pull origin main
# 3. Push
git push origin main
